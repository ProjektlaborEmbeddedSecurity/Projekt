# Project
This repository contains a running version of the current software on the master branch. Any other branch may contain experimental software that will not work.

# Hardware - Board
The project itself was tested on Arduino DUE and should work with Mega, too. 

# Hardware - Sensors
For humidity and temperature the sensor DHT11 was used. 
For distance measurement an ultrasonic sensor HC - SR04 was used, providing 2cm - 400cm distance measurement with an accuracy of 3mm.
